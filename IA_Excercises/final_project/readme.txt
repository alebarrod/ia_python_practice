This exercise consists of developing an algorithm shown in the unit 3 of the AI course.
All the exercises are explained in the file.
Titanic.py can be generated from the learn_tree.py file using the functions on the 4th part. The tree learned can generate a one node tree because the generation of the train, valid and test set is random (using shuffle) so if this happens repeat the process again.
