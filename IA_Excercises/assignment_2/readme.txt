This file contains a genetic algorithm prepared to execute a knapsack problem, but can be adapted to other fitness and decode functions.
This algorithm do not admit multiplicity unless the multiple objects appear multiple times in weights and value lists.
To use it to solve a problem, it is needed two lists (weights and values) ordered keeping in mind that each index correspond to the same object (weight/value) and generate a problem genetic filling the data as needed.
